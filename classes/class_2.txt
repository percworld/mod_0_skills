Cleaner

Attributes:

productAmount (float)
previousProductAmount (float)
dailyUse (float)
timeOfCleaning (datetime)


Methods:

orderNew (returns a yes if product_amount is under 16)
dailyUse (subtracts productAmount from previousProductAmount)
usingTooMuch (subtracts productAmount from previousProductAmount. That answer is compared to dailyUse and if it exceeds
dailyUse's value it returns true)
alertEmployee (warns of a discrepancy where not enough product was used the day before by subtracting productAmount
from previousProductAmount then comparing it to dailyUse.   If this result is less than half of the daily use value, a true value
is returned.  Also warns with a return of true if timeOfCleaning is past 22:00.)
