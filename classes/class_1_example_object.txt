Instance: soup_bowl

diameter = 6.5
totalNumber = 32
dirtyNumber = 4
stackable = true



Methods:

inUse (multiplies dirtyNumber by 2) = 4 * 2 = 8
shelved (uses stackable: if stackable is true then uses totalNumber integer minus dirtyNumber) = 32 - 4 = 28
dishwasherArea (uses diameter multiplied by dirtyNumber + .75) = 6.5 * 4 + .75 = 26.75
tableArea (multiplies diameter by 1.5) = 6.5 * 1.5 = 9.75
